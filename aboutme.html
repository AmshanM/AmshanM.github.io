        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am a second-year student at the University Of Toronto, doing the Neuroscience Specialist (Co-op) Program.
            My research interests are based on the neuroscience of decision making, attention, and sensory-motor integration.
            To relate this to neuromodulation, I am interested in brain-computer interfaces that analyze and interpret decision-making and attention.
            Driven by a relentless passion for innovation and a commitment to excellence, I am dedicated to leveraging my skills to create meaningful, positive change in the world.
            Let's build a brighter future together.
